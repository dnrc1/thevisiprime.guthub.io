                    <p><b>Lutein:</b> There are different studies supporting the benefits of lutein in improving eye health by protecting the eyes from harmful UV rays. Lutein added to the VisiPrime formula also has antioxidant properties that can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the eyes.</p>
                    <p><b>Bilberry Extract:</b>Bilberry extract supports lutein’s ability to defend your eye health. It also washes away the toxic microorganisms that may have plagued your eyes.</p>

For instance, it is needed for energy production, it helps activate antioxidants,</p>
					<p><b>Vitamin C:</b> Also known as L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin essential for collagen, L-carnitine, and the production of certain neurotransmitters. Ongoing research has shown its antioxidant function to be superior, namely, limiting the negative impacts of oxidative stress [1]. In the context of vision, one source explained that vitamin C might lower the risk of developing cataracts and when taken in conjunction with other essential nutrients</p>
